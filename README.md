# Wordle
Python project simulating The New York Times hit game wordle. 

Download the gitWordle.py and words.dat files and have them in the same directory to play.

In order to turn on cheatmode, delete the # symbol on line 123 to see the current word while guessing. Using the commands "+", "?", and "." will start a new game, show turn history for a given game, and quit the game respectively.

Thank you for reading my work, I hope you enjoyed my first project.
